# whoscored_scraper
WhoScored scraper using Selenium

This is a very basic demo on how to scrape data from whoscored for football fans

I have also added sample dataframe for reference

Code is very straightforward and I've added comments wherever it seemed necessary

Please ask if any doubt or have any suggestion
